## Using NED
In order for the NED application to operate properly, [.NET Runtime 6.0.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) must be downloaded.

### Precautions
- Only keys between 10 and 74 can be decrypted **without** error.
- High recursions are probably not good to use...

### Accessing The App
- Locate .Windows Forms NED/NEDApplication/Debug/net6.0-windows/Windows Forms NED.exe
- Windows Forms NED.exe
- Have fun :D

## Planned Updates
